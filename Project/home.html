		<h2>So, what is Dungeons & Dragons?</h2>
		<p>Dungeons and Dragons is a role-playing game where you create a character who will go through a storyline that's guided by a "Dungeon Master" (DM). 
		The DM can use one of the storylines that is provided by Wizards of the Coast (the company that makes the game), or they can create their own fictional world 
		with characters in a world that they've created. You get to choose what your character does in the world you're playing in. Imagine you're reading a really 
		good book - but instead of reading about what the character is doing, you get to choose! For example, you may begin a game session like this:</p>
		<p>Your DM says "You wake up and find yourself in a small room. On the nightstand beside the bed you see a folded note with 
		your name written on the front, and a key beside it. On the south wall there is a small window with a locked shutter, through which you hear the ocean; 
		on the north wall there is a wooden door. There is a small chest on the floor at the end of the bed with an iron lock on the front of it.
		You can hear a quiet knock coming from what appears to be a hidden trap door near your nightstand. What do you do?"</p>
		<p>And then you decide what your character will do! Most D&D games typically have anywhere from 4 to 6 players, 
		each with their own characters who are working together to advance through the plot of the story and achieve their goals.</p>

	<div class="WhyDoPeoplePlay">
		<h2>Okay, so why do people play this?</h2>
		<p>For the thrill of the adventures! Many who enjoy storytelling - whether it's writing the stories or reading/watching/listening to them - also enjoy 
		playing Dungeons & Dragons. Some have compared D&D to a "choose your own adventure" book. Others enjoy the role-playing aspect the most and enjoy playing 
		a character and being in the shoes of someone else for a while. But most of all, we play because it's FUN! The ultimate goal of any D&D experience should 
		be to have fun.</p>
